            Jawaharlal Nehru, born on November 14, 1889, was a central figure in Indian politics and a key figure in the struggle for India's independence.
            He played a crucial role in shaping the destiny of the country as its first Prime Minister, serving from 1947 until his death in 1964.

            Nehru, often addressed as "Pandit Nehru," was a close associate of Mahatma Gandhi and a leading member of the Indian National Congress.
            He was a strong advocate for secularism, democracy, and social justice. His vision for a modern, progressive India laid the foundation for the nation's development.

            Nehru's leadership saw the implementation of key policies and initiatives, including the initiation of five-year plans for economic development, the establishment of scientific and educational institutions, and the promotion of a non-aligned foreign policy.

            Beyond his political contributions, Nehru was also an eloquent writer and orator. His book "The Discovery of India" remains a classic on Indian history and culture.
