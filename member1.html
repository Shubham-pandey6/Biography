            Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was a prominent Indian nationalist leader who played a key role in India's struggle for independence against British rule.
            Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, Bose was known for his charismatic leadership and dedication to the cause of a free India.

            Bose served as the Congress President in 1938 and 1939 but later disagreed with Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent approach and formed the Forward Bloc in 1939.
            During World War II, he sought the help of Axis powers to free India and formed the Indian National Army (INA) to fight alongside the Japanese forces against the British.

            Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's famous slogan "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom!" resonated with the spirit of the Indian independence movement.
            Unfortunately, he died in a plane crash under mysterious circumstances in 1945.
